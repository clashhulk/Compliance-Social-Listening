# India Compliance Pain Tracker (MVP)

A lightweight web app to track and visualize compliance-related discussions from Indian public forums and news sources.

## What it does

- Collects recent posts from Reddit (r/IndiaTax, r/IndiaStartups) and RSS feeds (TaxGuru, Income Tax India, SEBI)
- Tags content by topic (GST, IncomeTax, TDS, etc.) and pain signals (PortalIssues, Deadlines, Negative sentiment)
- Shows a simple dashboard with trends, top tags, and searchable/filterable posts
- Auto-updates every 6 hours via GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**TL;DR:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Add Reddit credentials to .env
python collect.py
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Dashboard Features

- **KPIs**: Total posts, unique authors, sources tracked
- **Trend Chart**: Daily mentions over time
- **Top Tags**: Most common compliance topics and pain points
- **Data Table**: Searchable, filterable posts with links to originals
- **CSV Export**: Download filtered results

## Filters

- Date range (default: last 14 days)
- Source (Reddit / RSS)
- Tag contains (comma-separated for OR logic)
- Text search

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python collect.py  # Collect data
python -m streamlit run app.py  # Run dashboard
```

### Production (Streamlit Cloud)
1. Database is created by GitHub Actions (runs every 6 hours)
2. Stored as GitHub Artifacts (not in git)
3. Dashboard shows "Database not found" until first collection runs
4. Go to GitHub Actions tab → Run "Collect Compliance Data" workflow manually for first time
5. After first run, data auto-updates every 6 hours

**Note**: The dashboard will show "Database not found" on Streamlit Cloud until you run the GitHub Action the first time. This is normal - the database is generated by the automated workflow, not stored in git.
